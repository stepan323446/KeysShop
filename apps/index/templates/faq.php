        <h2>What is KeysShop?</h2>
        <p>KeysShop is a portfolio project designed to showcase web development skills. It simulates the functionality of an online store that sells software and gaming keys.</p>

        <h2>Can I purchase real keys on this website?</h2>
        <p>No, all products and keys on this site are invalid and for demonstration purposes only. Any purchases made are simulated in test mode.</p>

        <h2>What happens if I try to make a purchase?</h2>
        <p>When you attempt to make a purchase, the system will process the transaction in test mode using dummy data. No real payments will be made, and no real products will be delivered.</p>

        <h2>Is my payment information safe?</h2>
        <p>Since this is a demo site, no actual payment information is collected. All payment simulations are handled via Stripe's secure test environment, which does not process real data.</p>

        <h2>Why are the keys invalid?</h2>
        <p>The keys displayed on this site are placeholders created to demonstrate the functionality of an e-commerce store. They cannot be used for any real purposes.</p>

        <h2>Is this website open to the public?</h2>
        <p>While anyone can visit this site, its purpose is to serve as a demonstration for potential employers or collaborators. It is not intended for public use as a functional store.</p>

        <h2>Can I use this website for educational purposes?</h2>
        <p>Yes, you are welcome to explore the site to understand its design and functionality. However, the code and design are the intellectual property of the developer.</p>

        <h2>How can I contact the developer?</h2>
        <p>You can contact the developer through: <a target="_blank" href="https://steve-dekart.xyz/">website</a>, <a href="mailto:stevedekart2020@gmail.com">E-mail</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stepan-turitsin-009354243/">LinkedIn</a></p>
